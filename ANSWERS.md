During the birth/mounting phase the constructor method serves up initial state data for when the time comes to mount up DOM elements.

Custom hooks allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout components by reusing the same hook multiple times.Â  

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing is essential for software quality and should be integrated throughout the development process. Some of benefits of testing include: finding bugs faster, thinking about edge cases, and acting as a safety net and documentation.
